## New Proposal

**Cartesi Public Folder*

A public folder for serving NFT metadata and images

**Project Description**
<!-- [Write the description long-form here, or else paste a [google drive link](https://url/) to a slide deck]
-->
This project aims to create dynamic NFTs using the Cartesi Machine. Dynamic NFTs are NFTs that can change their characteristics according to certain circumstances that trigger their Cartesi Programs. They have metadata that describes their general and specific fields, which can be different for each NFT collection. They can change because of a special event like a DAO decision, or a video game progress.

<!-- My personal project involves using GANs (Generative Adversarial Networks) to generate realistic images for the dynamic NFTs. GANs are neural networks that can create images from random noise or input data. They consist of two models: a generator that creates images, and a discriminator that evaluates how real they look. GANs can be used to create various types of images, such as faces, animals, landscapes, etc. -->

The main challenge of this project is to enable the creation and updating of dynamic NFTs "on-chain" using the Cartesi Machine. Currently, most NFTs store the image and the metadata entirely off-chain or without any governance mechanism.

To overcome this challenge, We propose to use a public folder inside the Cartesi Machine that can store and update the images and metadata of the dynamic NFTs. The public folder would allow developers and users to access and modify the files on the Cartesi Machine. The public folder would also enable collaborative applications that require multiple parties to access the same files.

The main benefit of this project is that it would enable the creation of dynamic NFTs that are fully decentralized and transparent. The dynamic NFTs would not rely on any off-chain services or data sources to change their characteristics. The dynamic NFTs would also be verifiable by anyone who can inspect the state of the Cartesi Machine.

**Value proposition**
<!-- [Why would someone use this product/service? Or how does it add value to the Cartesi ecosystem or tech stack?]
Unlike the common NFTs that the metadata and assets are stored off-chain our dynamic NFTs inside public folder will be created and updated in a transparent way using the unique feature of Cartesi Machine.
