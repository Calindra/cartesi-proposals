## New Proposal

**Cartesi over Syscoin**

This project is a Proof of Concept to run the Cartesi technology over Syscoin solution.

**Project Description**
<!-- [Write the description long-form here, or else paste a [google drive link](https://url/) to a slide deck]
-->

This project aims to demonstrate the feasibility and potential of integrating Cartesi’s layer-2 solution with Syscoin’s network-enhanced virtual machine (NEVM), enabling developers to create scalable, secure, and decentralized applications using mainstream software stacks and tools.

**Value proposition**
<!-- [Why would someone use this product/service? Or how does it add value to the Cartesi ecosystem or tech stack?]
-->
This product/service leverages the computational power of Cartesi's layer-2 solution to process and analyze the big data that is accessible and retrievable from Syscoin’s network-enhanced virtual machine (NEVM), enabling developers to create scalable, secure, and decentralized applications using mainstream software stacks and tools. By integrating Cartesi with Syscoin, this product/service offers fast, low-cost, and interoperable transactions, as well as Ethereum-compatible smart contracts and decentralized applications. Moreover, by using PoDA protocol, this product/service ensures that the data needed to verify the off-chain computation is available to anyone who wants to verify it, without requiring the full data to be stored on the blockchain. This product/service also ensures the data availability of the blockchain itself, by using various methods to prevent data withholding attacks. This product/service adds value to the Cartesi ecosystem or tech stack by expanding its reach and compatibility, enhancing its performance and functionality, and increasing its adoption and innovation.

## How you will use Cartesi, specifically?

<!--[Details about how you're using Cartesi specifically, and why it makes sense. This is the most important part of the proposal. If you are not precise, or your intention is not feasible, the proposal will be rejected.]-->

Cartesi is a layer-2 solution that enables developers to use mainstream software stacks and tools to build smart contracts on top of any blockchain. Cartesi provides a Linux-based virtual machine (VM) that runs off-chain, but can be verified on-chain, allowing for complex and intensive computations to be performed without compromising the security and decentralization of the blockchain.

We are using Cartesi for our project because it offers several advantages that make it suitable for our needs. Some of these advantages are:

- **Programming flexibility**: Cartesi allows us to use familiar programming languages and tools, such as Python, R, SQL, or Pandas, to create and execute our smart contracts. This reduces the learning curve and the development time, as well as the complexity and cost of the code. It also enables us to access a rich set of libraries and frameworks that can enhance the functionality and performance of our smart contracts.
- **Scalability**: Cartesi enables us to perform large-scale computations off-chain, without being limited by the gas fees, block size, or throughput of the blockchain. This allows us to process and analyze the big data that is accessible and retrievable from Syscoin's network-enhanced virtual machine (NEVM), which offers fast, low-cost, and interoperable transactions, as well as Ethereum-compatible smart contracts and decentralized applications. By using Cartesi's VM, we can handle complex tasks such as machine learning, data mining, or optimization, that would otherwise be impractical or impossible on-chain.
- **Interoperability**: Cartesi allows us to deploy our smart contracts on any blockchain that supports smart contract execution, such as Syscoin's NEVM, Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, or Polygon. This gives us more flexibility and choice in selecting the best platform for our project, as well as the possibility to interact with other blockchains and platforms that offer different features and functionalities.

In summary, we are using Cartesi specifically because it enables us to create scalable, secure, and decentralized applications using mainstream software stacks and tools, while ensuring the data availability and verifiability of our smart contracts integrating with Syscoin's NEVM, which offers fast, low-cost, and interoperable transactions, as well as Ethereum-compatible smart contracts and decentralized applications. We believe that this combination of Cartesi and Syscoin makes sense for our project, as it offers the best of both worlds: a layer-2 solution that enhances the performance and functionality of the smart contracts, and a network-enhanced virtual machine that enhances the performance and functionality of the transactions. We think that this project will add value to the Cartesi ecosystem or tech stack by expanding its reach and compatibility, enhancing its performance and functionality, and increasing its adoption and innovation.
